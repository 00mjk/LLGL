Common

| Subject | Progress | Priority | Remarks |

| Stream outputs | 5% | Medium | An interface for stream outputs (transform feedback) is required |
| Command list | 0% | High | To be uniform with D3D12, split "RenderContext" functions into a "CommandList" interface |
| Texture arrays | 0% | High | Textures shall be grouped to arrays with a "TextureArray" interface |
| Query arrays | 0% | Medium | Queries shall be grouped to arrays with a "QueryArray" interface |
| Debug layer | 0% | Low | Optimize debug layer (especially when only the profiler is used) |
| Shader interfaces | 0% | Medium | An interface for shader interfaces (also "Subroutines") is required |
